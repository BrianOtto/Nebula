# Nebula

A Secure Scuttlebutt client for mobile devices (Android and iOS).

This is a work in progress. The UI is mostly built, and I have implemented the SSB protocol in a [barebones client](doc/reference/ssb-client.js), without any [SSBC](https://github.com/ssbc) dependencies. Now it's just a matter of hooking up the two together and getting local storage working.

You will need to install the [Fuse Tools](https://www.fusetools.com) environment in order to compile this application. I will provide instructions for doing this when the project gets further along. In the meantime, you can run a demo by installing the [Android APK](bin/Android/Release/Nebula.apk).
